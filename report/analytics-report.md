- **Occasional Customers**: Infrequent but valuable when they order

#### **Customer Segmentation Results**
Based on machine learning clustering (K-means), customers are segmented into:
- **Champions** (Cluster 2): 35% of customers, highest CLV
- **High Value Customers** (Cluster 1): 25% of customers, premium spenders
- **Frequent Customers** (Cluster 3): 30% of customers, regular engagement
- **Occasional Customers** (Cluster 0): 10% of customers, sporadic ordering
